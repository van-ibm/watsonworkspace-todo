# IBM Watson Workspace Todo Bot
As teams create spaces to address short and long term goals, they inevitably discuss what's needed to meet those goals. Todo bot monitors a team's conversation looking for action items or commitments. Space members can sign up for identified actions. Todo bot will not only track your todos but also the todos for the space.
